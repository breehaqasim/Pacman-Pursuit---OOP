# ðŸŽ® Pacman Pursuit - OOP

"Pacman Pursuit" is an engaging and challenging game that infuses elements from the classic Pac-Man game with the dynamic challenges of the World's Hardest Game. Developed using the SDL2 library in C++, this project offers a nostalgic yet fresh gameplay experience. Control the iconic Pac-Man, navigate through intricately designed mazes, avoid the pesky ghosts, and collect all the yellow dots to advance through levels.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
- Use the **arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)** to navigate Pac-Man through the maze.
- Aim to eat all the yellow dots on each level while avoiding collisions with the ghosts.
- Each collision with a ghost sends Pac-Man back to the starting area of the level and increments your failed attempts counter.
